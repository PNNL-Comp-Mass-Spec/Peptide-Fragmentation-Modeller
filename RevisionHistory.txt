	- Added ability to control which ions are shown using either an XML parameter file or command line switches
	- New switches:
		- /Double to show doubly charged ions; default is at 800 m/z or higher
			- Customize the m/z to 600 like this: /Double:600
		- /Triple to show triply charged ions; default is at 900 m/z or higher
			- Customize the m/z to 600 like this: /Triple:1100
		- /A to show A Ions
		- /B to show B Ions; use /B:False to disable B ions
		- /Y to show Y Ions; use /Y:False to disable Y ions
		- /C to show C Ions
		- /Z to show Z Ions
		- /NLWater to include water neutral loss ions
		- /NLAmmonia to include ammonia neutral loss ions
		- /NLPhosphate to include phosphate neutral loss ions
		- /Label to include a text label for each ion in the .DTA files
		- /Label:verbose to include verbose text labels
		- By default, will show B and Y ions, but not neutral loss ions
			- Disable an ion type using :False as shown above
		- Switch /ETD will turn off b and y ions and turn on c and z ions, and thus is equivalent to this set of switches
			/A:False /B:False /Y:False /C /Z
		- Switch /Overwrite will cause existing .DTA files to be overwritten
